## Installing Erlang

### Using an installer from Erlang Solutions

(https://www.erlang-solutions.com/downloads/download-erlang-otp) has downloads for
many platforms.

As we will be using Erlang 17 the ESL packages is often the best choice as they are
always serving the latest version. For some of the Linux distributions the Erlang
version may not be the latest.

### Homebrew for Mac OS X

```bash
$ brew install erlang
```

### On Linux

* Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install erlang`
* Fedora 17+ (only tried on 20) and Fedora Rawhide: `sudo apt-get install erlang`
* Arch Linux: `sudo pacman -Sy erlang` 

### Installing from Source

Get [Erlang 17](http://www.erlang.org/download.html) and follow the installation
instructions.


### Using kerl 

[kerl](https://github.com/spawngrid/kerl) can be used to manage several Erlang
versions.

This is a more flexible way of managing several Erlang versions, but it is also
slightly more involved, so probably not the first choice.

## Running tests

```bash
$ erl -noshell -eval "eunit:test(anagram_test, [verbose])"  -run init stop
```

This is equivalent to starting the Erlang shell and then run the command
`eunit:test(anagram_test, [verbose]).` 


## Recommended Learning Resources

Exercism provides exercises and feedback but can be difficult to jump into for those
learning Erlang for the first time. These resources can help you get started:

* [Learn You Some Erlang](http://learnyousomeerlang.com) by Freb HÃ©bert. Covers
  everything from basic Erlang, over OTP to release creation.
* [Erlang Programming](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596518189.do) by Francesco
  Cesarini and Simon Thompson. Focuses on basic Erlang without OTP. Very good for
  understanding the principles that OTP is built upon.
*
  [Designing for Scalability with Erlang/OTP](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920024149.do)
  the sequel to Erlang Programming, where the focus is on how to use OTP to craft
  amazing systems. As of June 2014 still in "Early Release".
* [Erlang and OTP in Action](http://manning.com/logan/) by Martin Logan, Eric
  Merritt, and Richard Carlsson. Shows how to use OTP.
* [Programming Erlang](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9781937785536.do) by Joe
  Armstrong. Joe is one of the fathers of Erlang and has a good focus on how to think
  in Erlang.
* [Erlang Documentation](http://www.erlang.org/doc.html)
* [Erlang-Questions Mailing List](http://erlang.org/pipermail/erlang-questions/) -
  very friendly and helpful community.
* [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)
